# Halochat

WIP for nostr client in svelte and typescript.

Bugs

- [ ] Plenty. Need to clean redundant functions
- [ ] Loading of prefetched data should be in chunks for quicker responsiveness
- [ ] Reply e tag and p tags still not clear when to use <root>
- [ ] Loading of meta data should not block main thread
- [ ] Find a better way to present the notes in a tree fashion
- [ ] Need to find a way when data is loaded and new data is added, to make sure it is not disruptive when you are reading and the screen scrolls up or down to add new data
